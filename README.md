## Topic

Personal expenses manager application.

## Inspiration

The idea comes from this [opensource application](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-finance-manager): the app design is very old, sluggish and it doesn't provide any features as statistics. The current implementation also presents two bugs in the import-export workflow, that compromise the data.

## Plan

The intention is to rebuild the aforementioned app from scratch, implement the missing features, provide a solid import-export workflow of the raw user-data (to permit using them in other data-analysis tools), try a general UI overhaul with [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) and improve the UX.
